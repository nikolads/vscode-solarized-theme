# Solarized Improved

Customized solarized theme for `vscode`.

It is the same as the default solarized themes except for the following changes:

- fixed foreground colors to match what the [solarized theme][solarized_github] specifies they should be
    - light theme: changed from black (#073642/#333333) to base00 gray (#657b83)
    - dark theme: changed from white (#93a1a1/#bbbbbb) to base0 gray (#839496)
- dark theme: changed cursor from red to foreground color
- removed the highlight of the line with the cursor
